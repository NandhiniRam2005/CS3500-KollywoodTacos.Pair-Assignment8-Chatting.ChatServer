# Assignment Specific Topics
1. Instrumenting your code to log the "right" message, to the "right" place, at the "right" time..
2. Understand and describe how networking code works
3. Understand how to protect critical regions from race conditions encountered in parallel programs. 
We apply all these assignment specific topics by adding threading to handle multiple clients at the same time. We also do this by adding and
implementing a Network Connection Class. We also implement Debugging in all of our classes such as Networking, ChatServer, and ChatClient.Client.
# Overview of the Chatting Client functionality
Our chat client is able to handle multiple users at the same time and broadcast users' messages to each other. The chat client provides helpful 
logging messages that help developers figure out where errors could have possibly happened without having to debug their code. 
Future extensions of the chatting client is to apply it to our game project.


# Examples of Good Software Practice (GSP).  
1. Self Documenting Code - My code uses good variable names and easy to read syntax. For example I vouch for using for each statements with good variable names 
   to ensure my code is easy to read even without comments.
2. Style - I ensure to follow the style guidelines that were given to us in class and in documents shared on canvas. I do not have unindented code or code that is hard 
   to read in my solution.
3. XML Documentation - In addition to having self documenting code I made sure to write good XML comments for all my member variables, methods, and tests. This ensures
   that in addition to my code being easy to read there are also concise XML comments that are easy to read both on-line and in an IDE using intellisense. 
Others I have achieved are:
1. Well named, commented, short methods that do a specific job and return a specific result.
2. Abstraction

# Time Management Skills
Throughout this project I have learned many things about time management skills and estimation skills. One of the main things I have learned is 
that if anything it is best to overestimate how long you think an assignment will take you that way you can plan ahead and have the proper amount
of time dedicated to it. I have also learned that it is good to not sit down and do all your coding in one sitting. This leads to you missing
edge cases or possibly forgetting to do certain things in your work. I think I have been getting slowly better with my time estimation skills and will
continue to get better as the semester continues.

# Time Management Skills  / Time Tracking - A8
Throughout this assignment we learned more about time tracking and how to accurately estimate our time and improve our time management skills. We both felt
that working with a partner added more pressure to being focused because both of grades are on the line. This led to us working on the assignment more 
diligently. We also felt like we were able to accurately predict how long the assignment take us, which was about 13 hours. We hope to take these skills into 
our next assignments.
