# Assignment Specific Topics
Our assignment specific topics include creating a Webserver that is connected to our data base to show the Snake Game's status oof the 
games and players playing it. It is designed to handle HTTP requests and responses. The server processes incoming client requests and 
supports basic web server functionalities. This Web Server console app has three main basic html functionalities from showing
the home page, the list of games (games table from database), and links to the player's table showing their name, ID, max score, start and 
end time.
